# Overview
This project maps the social network structure of popular hip hop artists through track features.

Data is collected via the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) using the [`spotifyr`](https://github.com/charlie86/spotifyr) library in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 

As a work in progress, this project is largely organized as a notebook (`rap-feature-network-notebook.Rmd` in the `2_scripts` subdirectory).
