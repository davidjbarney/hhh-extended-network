# Overview
This project maps the structure of artist features in popular hip hop with network science methodology, specifically motivated by sociological approaches to social network analysis.

Data is collected via the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) using the [`spotifyr`](https://github.com/charlie86/spotifyr) library in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 

As a work in progress, this project is currently organized as a notebook (`rap-feature-network-notebook.Rmd` in the `2_scripts` subdirectory).
